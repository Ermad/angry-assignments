* "delete all" for pages, or some other way to prevent infinite buildup
* don't allow someone who's promoted in a raid to change pages, unless the leader of their current raid is an officer in the guild
* raid icons support in on-screen display
* ability to hide the on-screen display, but force it to re-appear everytime page is edited, or current page changes
* some sort of brief graphical effect whenever current page gets edited
* let user specify keywords to highlight in the on-screen display (don't do their own name by default, let them put it in if they want)
* if in a raid currently, version check needs to display which raid members aren't running the addon
* fix guild rank/membership checks (discussed)

Angry Assignments - Tired of all those macros to manage raid assignments?

With recent raid tiers, it has become required to have specific assigments for each boss. This is frequently handled by having a macro that the raid leader updates and spams to raid chat. While this gets the job done, it creates many annoyances and bottlenecks after a while.

To help improve this for my guild, I wrote an addon called Angry Assignments. It allows guild officers / raid assistants to collaboratively edit pages of text, which can then be displayed on your raiders screen.
